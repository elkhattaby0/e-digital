      If you’ve ever wondered "How much should I pay someone to build my website?" or "Can I get one for free?", you're not alone. 
      
      In 2025, website prices still vary a lot depending on what you need, who builds it, and how big your site is. This guide answers the most asked questions about pricing from simple one page sites to bigger ones with dozens of pages. 
      
      You'll also see how platforms like <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress</a>, and <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> compare when it comes to price.

      People ask this all the time: 
  
  - type: list
    items:
      - "What’s a fair price?" 
      - "What’s normal? Should I pay $500 or $5,000?"
    
  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      In 2025, the average website cost can be as low as $100 for a basic DIY builder site, or as high as $10,000+ for larger business websites done by professional developers. 
      
      The price depends on the platform, the number of pages, and if you're hiring a freelancer, an agency, or using a builder tool.

      The more pages you have, the more work there is which means higher cost. Here's a quick breakdown of what you can expect in 2025:

  - type: table
    headers: [ "Pages", "Estimated Cost (USD)", "Ideal For" ]
    rows: [
      [ "1 Page", "$100 – $400", "Landing pages, link pages"],
      [ "5 Pages", "$400 – $900", "Small business, portfolio"],
      [ "10 Pages", "$800 – $1,800", "Local business, blogs"],
      [ "20 Pages", "$1,500 – $3,000", "Medium-sized business websites"],
      [ "50 Pages", "$3,000 – $6,000", "Corporate sites, directories"],
      [ "100+ Pages", "$5,000+", "Complex platforms, large catalogs"]
    ]

    text: "Can You Build a Website for Free?"

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Technically, <i>yes</i>. 
      
      There are platforms that let you create a basic site at no cost (like <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>), but you’ll be limited in features, storage, speed, and branding. You'll often still need to pay for a domain, remove ads, or access better templates.

      If your business depends on trust and performance, a free option might not be the best fit.

      Here’s what many want to know: Is GoDaddy worth it? How much does Squarespace cost? Should I just go with WordPress?

  - type: table
    headers: [ "Platform", "Starting Cost", "Ease of Use", "Best For" ]
    rows: [
      [ "GoDaddy", "$10/month", "Easy", "Beginners, fast launch" ],
      [ "Squarespace", "$16/month", "Very easy", "Creatives, small shops" ],

      WordPress gives you more control, but has a learning curve. Squarespace is cleaner out of the box. GoDaddy is somewhere in between.
