      Agadir, one of Morocco’s top coastal destinations, is attracting thousands of tourists every month in 2025 — from beach lovers to digital nomads. But there’s a major shift: <b>travelers today choose their hotel before they even land in Morocco</b>, and they do it online.

      If your hotel’s website isn’t built for today’s travelers, you’re not just missing visitors — you’re missing direct bookings.

      Your website is your digital front desk. Here’s what modern tourists expect:

  - type: list
    items:
      - <b>Mobile-First Design</b> – Over 70% of bookings now come from mobile devices.
      - <b>Fast Booking Experience</b> – No complicated forms or PDFs.
      - <b>Real Photos & Virtual Tours</b> – Guests want to “see” before they book.
      - <b>Trust & Reviews</b> – Integrations with Google or TripAdvisor reviews boost confidence.

      If your hotel lacks any of the above, it’s time for a serious upgrade.

Their <b>modern, fast, and multilingual websites</b> help them appear at the top of Google searches and get <b>direct bookings</b> — no commissions to OTAs.
