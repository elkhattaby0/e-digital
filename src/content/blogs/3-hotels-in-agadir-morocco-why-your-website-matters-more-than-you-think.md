  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Agadir is a favorite spot for travelers coming to Morocco. The beach, the sunshine, the souks - people from all over the world search daily for a place to stay here. 

      But if you're running a hotel in Agadir, you've likely noticed something: "it’s not just about having rooms available".

      The real question is:

      <i>“Why do some hotels in Agadir stay fully booked, while others barely get clicks?”</i>

      It often comes down to how your hotel looks online.

      Let’s get straight to it. Every month, travelers search Google for:

  - type: list
    items:
      - <i>hotels in Agadir</i>
      - <i>best hotels in Agadir Morocco</i>
      - <i>where to stay in Agadir</i>
      - <i>cheap hotels near the beach in Agadir</i>
      - <i>Agadir hotels with pool</i>

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      These are real search terms, pulled from tools like <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">SEMrush.</a> The volume is there - and growing.

      But if your hotel doesn’t appear on that first page, you’re missing bookings. If your website takes too long to load, or doesn’t look good on a phone, most people will leave and book elsewhere.

      Think about it: the first impression guests get isn’t your front desk - it’s your homepage.

      A clean layout, real photos, clear prices, and fast loading - these things build trust in seconds. And trust leads to bookings.

      On the other hand, if your site looks outdated or is hard to use, it tells people your hotel might be the same.

      - Check availability without calling

      - Book right there, without visiting a third party site

      Without these features, it’s easy to lose someone to the next hotel on Google.
